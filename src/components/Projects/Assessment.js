              Two common phrases surrounding assessment recently are assessment
              for improvement and assessment for accountability. While
              assessment for accountability's is an important reason to initiate
              and conduct assessment, the real benefit to an institution and its
              students come from the discussions and changes that happen as a
              result of assessment for improvement.
              <br />
              <br />
              Many staff are motivated by the benefits of focusing on assessment
              for improving the quality of teaching, learning, programs and
              services, and planning and decision-making. The purpose of
              assessment for accountability is to demonstrate the effectiveness
              of programs and services across the institution to various
              audiences, including parents.

              Writing is the art of expressing our views, ideas, and
              thoughts.Writing is a very important skill anywhere, anytime as
              long as we live. Through writing, we communicate to teachers to
              receive grades in school. Effective writing can be a task as it
              demands much more than correct grammar. It is about to gain
              knowledge about sentence structure, develop your vocabulary, and
              build other basic writing skills.
