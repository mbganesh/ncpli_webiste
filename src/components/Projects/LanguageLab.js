              Language Lab works by enabling a teacher to control all student
              computers within a computer- based classroom. The most logical way
              to set up Language Lab is for each classroom or room to have a
              teacher computer. This setup enables all of the computers in the
              same classroom to interact with each other and one teacher to
              control the entire room.
              <br />
              <br />
              After installing the software on each computer in a classroom, one
              system can act as a teacher or server and remaining system can act
              as a student or client. The teacher can monitor students as they
              join and/or leave the class. This makes it easy to see who is
              absent or who has joined the class.

              After installing the teacher setup or server setup in the

              Writing is the art of expressing our views, ideas, and
              thoughts.Writing is a very important skill anywhere, anytime as
              long as we live. Through writing, we communicate to teachers to
              receive grades in school. Effective writing can be a task as it
              demands much more than correct grammar. It is about to gain
              knowledge about sentence structure, develop your vocabulary, and
              build other basic writing skills.
