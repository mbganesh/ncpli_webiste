              A kiosk is an interactive system designed for public use that
              delivers information or enables transactions. Standard or custom
              applications developed for information kiosks provide customers
              with information, the ability to participate in loyalty programs,
              and transaction capability. Enterprises deploy kiosks to increase
              customer loyalty, strengthen their brand with target customers,
              and reduce operational costs.
